# Salesforce Marketing Cloud - Transactional Send Journey & Event Notification Service - Postman Collection

## Introduction

This is a [Postman](https://postman.com) collection containing the necessary requests to interact with *Transactonal Send Journeys* and set up the *Event Notification Service* in Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

## Setup

Create a set of environment variables and define the following ones:

 - clientId (the client id from the installed package in Marketing Cloud)
 - clientSecret (the client id from the installed package in Marketing Cloud)
 - accountId (the MID of your Marketing Cloud business unit or account)
 - authEndpoint (the authentication endpoint from the installed package in Marketing Cloud)
 - hostEndpoint (the REST endpoint from the installed package in Marketing Cloud)
 - access_token (no need to set a value here)

## Usage

Import the collection into [Postman](https://postman.com), select the environment you set up earlier and modify the requests to suit your needs. This includes setting the desired keys, adding the subscriber information you need to use, and switching the IDs with the ones you get back from some other requests.

The first request you need to send is the one called *Request SFMC Token v2* in order to authenticate your API requests.

## API documentation

The API endpoints that are part of the collection are documented by Salesforce here:
